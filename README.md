# GOLD-PRICE-PREDICTION-ML

 The price of gold is volatile, they change rapidly with time.
 Our main Aim of this project will be to predict the price of gold per unit.
 Gold prices are affected by a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, interest rates, currency fluctuations, geopolitical events, and demand and supply dynamics.
 Traditional models for predicting gold prices often rely on statistical methods, such as regression analysis, time-series analysis, and econometric models. 
 However, these models have limitations in capturing the complexity of the market dynamics and may not be able to account for sudden changes in market conditions. 
 Machine learning, on the other hand, can handle large and complex data sets and can learn from historical patterns to make predictions. 
 There are various machine learning algorithms that can be used for gold price prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. I
